# Teaching Materials 

If you teach high school or college-level German language classes, click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qUFjtANOm1kX6L6RChtfLrqijrOSyv_f?usp=sharing) to access teaching materials about Ernst Karl Winter. There, you will find a Google Drive folder with materials for a unit called "Erinnerung." The unit is comprised of 12 lessons for students with German language proficiencies between A2 and B2 as defined by the [Common European Framework of Reference](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions). Each lesson is meant to last around 75-minutes. For the final assessment, students create their own personal digital archive. If you would like to publish your students' archives on this site, please contact Mari McCarville at mari.mccarville@colorado.edu. 

While the lessons were designed to be taught in order, please feel free to teach them in whatever way works best for you. You may only want to use a few activities, or you may want to teach the entire unit as it is. If you decide to teach all 12 lessons, begin by reading the unit plan. Then, click on each lesson's folder to find slides and handouts.
